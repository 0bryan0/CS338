Alice, Bob, Evem MAL have access to: 
 - AES: AES(K, M), where K = key, M = msg 
 - Diffie-Hellman: procudeure to share a secret key in public 
 - SHA-256: H(M)
 - Private/Public key pairs: (P_a, S_a), (P_b, S_b) 


================== Simple communication scenarios ==================

1.  Alice and Bob can use the Diffie Hellman procudeure to share
    a secret key for AES, K. After sharing K, they can en/decrypt 
    using AES. 
     -  The sole goal is to prevent anyone else from being able 
        to read the message. So the simplest thing is to 
        encrpyt the message. Symmetric encrpytion is viable with
        Diffie-Hellman. 

2.  Alice can hash the message M through SHA-256, and add that 
    to the end of the unhashed message: M || H(M)
     -  Bob can check the message he recieved, M'. and put it 
        through SHA-256 to see if it matches H(M). If changes 
        were made to M, H(M') will probably be vastly different 
        from H(M). 

3.  Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to exchange a secret key, K. 
    Alice hashes her message M to get the digest H(M). Then Alice 
    can use a digital signature to verify that the message is 
    actually from Alice. Alices does this by using their secret 
    key to encrypt the digest: E(S_a, H(M)). Then Alice encrypts
    M || E(S_a, H(M)) --> AES(M || E(S_a, H(M)), K). 
     -  Eve cannot read the message as it is encrpyted. Bob can
        decrypt the entire message(fairly quickly as it is AES) 
        and then use Alice's public key to decrypt the signature
        to ensure authenticity. Thus, public key encryption is
        used only where it is needed to save time/computation. 


================ Questions about breaking security ================

4.  (a) Alice could say her private key was compromised. 
        This means Bob or maybe Mal used Alice's private key to 
        get a signature that matches the fake message. 
            -   This is not impossible and more investigation 
                would need to happen about how the key was  
                compromised. How secure a private key is depends
                on how secure it was kept.
    (b) Alice could claim Bob attatched a fake C, a C'. 
        This is nearly impossible, as the Sig would not match 
        if C' was hashed. 
    (c) Alice could claim Bob attatched a fake C and a fake Sig.
        This is also pretty close to impossible, as Bob would need
        to either have Alice's public key(scenario 1) or reverse
        engineer the encrpytion using the public key which we know
        is really hard to do. Or Bob would need to find a collision
        in the hash function, but this would be not only hard to do
        in general, but also the result of the collision would
        have to weirdly line up to be a similar format to C. 

5.  Sig_CA = E(S_CA, H("bob.com" || P_B))

6.  Alice needs to get Bob to make a digital signature to make sure
    the public key from thecertificate matches up/can decrpyt the
    ciphertext from "Bob's" secret key. 
        Alice can tell Bob to make a signautre for a specified 
        message M. So Bob would send E(S_b,H(M)). 
        Alice then decrpyts this using the public key from the
        certificate and sees if it truly equals H(M).

7.  (a) Mal could just pretend to be the CA 
        (i.e AITM between CA and Bob) and send a fake Cert_B.
        If Alice does not verify the signature, then Alice 
        would think she is talking to Bob.
    (b) Mal could somehow get a hold of the secret key of the
        CA, meaning they can give out certificates to anyone.
