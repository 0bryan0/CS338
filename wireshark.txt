    NIST server used: 132.163.97.4 ( WWV, Fort Collins, Colorado )

    1. TCP handshake frames:
        1	0.000000000	192.168.231.128	132.163.97.4	TCP	74	52604 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=32120 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=1500831297 TSecr=0 WS=128
        2	0.039272104	132.163.97.4	192.168.231.128	TCP	60	13 → 52604 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460
        3	0.040191305	192.168.231.128	132.163.97.4	TCP	54	52604 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=32120 Len=0
    2. Port # used by client: 52604
    3. Client has many services that can receive info from internet. 
       daytime needs to know which one to hand the info back to.
    4. Frame with time: 
        4	0.063902523	132.163.97.4	192.168.231.128	DAYTIME	105	DAYTIME Response
    5. SYN = synchronized seq number
       ACK = acknowledgement
    6. Client initiated the closing. 
        5	0.064258731	192.168.231.128	132.163.97.4	TCP	54	52604 → 13 [FIN, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=53 Win=32068 Len=0
        Frame 5 shows source as client's IP. And the message info has the [FIN]

===== HTTP SECTION =====
    1. Just one? There is never a [FIN] that closes the first one.
    2.  Frame 5 has the GET request: 
        5	0.016274421	192.168.231.128	172.233.221.124	HTTP	408	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 
    3. Frame 11 has the GET request for the file jeff-square-colorado.jpg:
        11	0.094617906	192.168.231.128	172.233.221.124	HTTP	381	GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1 

===== QUESTIONS =====
 - What is a [PSH] and why are there so many of them?
 - What does "TCP segment of a reassembled PDU" mean?
 - If a packet is not being acknowledged by my computer, it won't ever
   show up on my wireshark, correct? I can only see when a packet I sent
   doesn't get acknolwedged?
