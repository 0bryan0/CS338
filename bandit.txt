Level 0 -> 1
    I did 'ls', then 'cat readme' to see the contents of the readme file. 
    PW: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
Level 1 -> 2
    I did 'ls', then used the full path of the dash filename: 'cat ./-' 
    PW: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

Level 4 -> 5
    cd into inhere. Did 'file ./*'(the files start with dashes) to find readable file.

Level 5 -> 6
    Use 'find . -type f size 1033 ! -executable' to get file, with certain size, and not execuatable
    Then 'exec file '{}' \;' to get the file data types of each file from the find cmd.
    Then pipe that all into 'grep ASCII' to get the files that have ACII data types. 
    Combined: find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file '{}' \; | grep ASCII

Level 6 -> 7
    Did 'find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c', found "/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password"
    PW: morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
Level 7 -> 8
    Did 'cat data.txt | grep millionth' since grep will get the the whole line
    PW: dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
Level 8 -> 9
    man uniq shows that -u will only print unique lines. But apparantly only works if everything is sorted.  
    Did sort data.txt | uniq -u
    PW: 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
Level 9 -> 10
    'string data.txt' gets all human readable strings from data.txt
    Pipe that into 'grep =' like so: 'strings data.txt | grep ='
    PW: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
Level 10 -> 11
    Did 'base64 -d data.txt' to decode
    PW: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr  
Level 11 -> 12
    Need to find the right way to use 'tr'. This was kinda annoying to figure out.
    'A-Za-z' is the first array of chars. Replace it with 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
    so 'cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m''
