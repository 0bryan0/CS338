E((n,e), M) = M^e mod n  <-- can be done fast
Given (n,e), find d so that e*d mod lambda(n) = 1 <-- can't

===========================================
+ In-class exam, Friday, October 11
- General philosophy on in-class exams
    - Stuff I want you to have in your head
        - YES "base64 encodes/rewrites arbitrary byte sequences
            as sequences of ASCII characters"
        - MAYBE "to encode, take each 3-byte chunk and turn it into
            4 6-bit chunks, and look those chunks up on a table"
        - NO "the letter Z represents the six bits 011001"
    - I'm happy if no more than 5 people are still working at
        the end of the exam
    - No tricks or intentionally obscure questions (at least I try)
    - Facts, yes. Also some "why" (e.g., why do we use certificates
        at all? why is it easier to secure an asymmetric key pair
        than a symmetric key?)
    - Fair game
        - Readings
        - Videos
        - Class notes
        - Labs
        - Assignments
    - Thinking about how to prioritize study

        - What did I emphasize in homework?
        - What did I emphasize in class?
        - What did I emphasize in the videos?

    - What mathematical relationships do the various numbers
        (n, e, d, p, q) have?
    - How do you encrypt/decrypt?
        Alice to Bob. Alice uses Bob's pub key.

    - What are the limits on the size (in bits or bytes)
        of the messages that you can encrypt using
        a given RSA key? 
        - length of message should less than modulus

- Public-key/asymmetric encryption in general
    - Notation I'll use: public key P, secret key S,
        encrypt/decrypt using the function E
        E(P, M) or E(S, M) for message M

        - works simarly to hash, but also has encryption

- base64
    - What is it?
        - encoding, convert binary data to string of ascii data

        - 3 bytes chunks(24 bits)
            - divided again into 6 bit chunks
                - each 6 bit unit converted to printable ascii char
