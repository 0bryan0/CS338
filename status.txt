Name: Bryan Yang

Plan for using Kali: 
    I will try to mostly use Kali on my own laptop

Current status of Kali install:
    I downloaded the VM on my laptop and installed Kali on there. 
    Burpsuite is working as well.
        I had a hiccup with Burp, where I couldn't open the browser after
        starting interception. I just restarted the VM and it worked.
